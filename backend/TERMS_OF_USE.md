Terms of Use
Welcome to Vibe Music App! By using this innovative platform, you agree to the following comprehensive Terms of Use. We also encourage you to review the linked disclaimer of warranty for additional information.

Both Vibe Music App, Inc. and the dedicated developers behind this remarkable app have implemented a data collection process focused on enhancing the app's capabilities. This endeavor is undertaken with utmost care and dedication to safeguarding user privacy. Rest assured that no information that could be directly attributed to any individual is stored.

It's important to be aware that the utilization of user inputs, including playlist selections and feedback, may be subject to storage. While it's theoretically possible to establish connections between a person's music preferences or feedback and their real-life identity, please note that the creators of Vibe Music App explicitly assure that such attempts will never be made.

For a deeper understanding of Vibe Music App's overarching terms of use, we encourage you to explore the details available here.

Optionally, Vibe Music App collects usage data for the purpose of improving the app. Data collection only happens when a consent file called .vma_consent is present in the Vibe Music App directory. Note that Vibe Music App cannot prevent that data streams passing through the app to a third party may be stored by that third party (for example, our music streaming service providers).

Your engagement with Vibe Music App is an acknowledgment and acceptance of these terms, demonstrating your commitment to using this platform responsibly and within the bounds of ethical conduct. We appreciate your trust and look forward to the exciting possibilities that Vibe Music App can offer in your musical journey.
